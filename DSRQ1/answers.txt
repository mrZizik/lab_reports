3. Transparency is property of DS to present itself as single computer system.
There are 
	access transparency (hiding differencies in data representation and way of acess to resources),
	ex. search engines - we don't care in which way data is stored in internet, google just give as info
 	
 	location, migration and relocation transparency (hiding of location and movements of resources even while in use), 
  	ex. dns - we didn't need to know where dns records are located on system and are they moved or not.

  	replication transparency,
  	ex. cdn service - 

  	concurrency transparency (hiding of using of resource by several competitive users),
  	also webservers


  	failure transparency (hiding failures and recovery of resources)
  	torrents
