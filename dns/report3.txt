Step by Step Unbound caching server setup
1. wget http://unbound.net/downloads/unbound-1.5.9.tar.gz
2. sha256sum unbound-1.5.9.tar.gz should be "01328cfac99ab5b8c47115151896a244979e442e284eb962c0ea84b7782b6990". By this we assure of integrity of file.
3. tar -xzvf unbound-1.5.9.tar.gz
4. cd unbound-1.5.9
5. ./configure
6. make
7. make install ++
8. Go to /usr/local/etc/unbound/unbound.conf and edit it. There we should specify port, interfaces and eneble remote control and ower username. 
9. Then we should chown unbound files to ower user, log file for example, cause it'll downgrade it's priveleges and can't edit them.
10. After that we can start unbound with unbound-control start and look for status with unbound-status
10.5 By the way unbound has root server addreses in it's code, but we can put them to root.hints file near configration.
11. We can check our cache server with dig. dig ya.ru @127.0.0.1 first time will return answer with some delay, next time it will do it in 0 ms, because answer is already cached.

Answers: 
1. Signature verification helps us to be assure in programms integrity.
2. In my mind SHA256 is best, cause it's easy to check and still gains needed level of security. But most sites also gives another variations
3. It saves big amount of time, that will be spent to find host going from root, to another servers etc.
In our example, first query goes in 200-500ms, next in 0ms of course. 
4. unbound.conf
5. Cause it helps to use one programs when writing another
6. Added control-enable: yes
7. stop/status/start etc.
8. nameserver 127.0.0.1

First 8 steps of installing is like for unbound.
Our configration file is located at /etc/nsd/nsd.conf
9. We should change the port in our config, to avoid conflicts with unbound
10. Next we should create zone file in zone folder with our st9.os3.su. zone
11. When we added all neede records, we can change config of nsd, and add 
	zone:
 		name: "st9.os3.su."
 		zonefile: "st09.os3.su"
12.
