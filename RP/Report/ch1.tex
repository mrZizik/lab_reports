Currently not all applications can be verified and compared via traditional ways like a hash sums or signs. Mobile applications can be changed or repacked with some malicious code before installation. Target of our work is to determine malicious behaviour of repacked applications based on their resources consumption. In our work we plan to test the usage of different resources such as CPU, battery and so on to determine that malicious activity.
